This repository is a dedicated archive of my firmware projects developed for the **AVR Atmel** architecture. It showcases low-level driver development, register manipulation, and hardware peripheral interfacing.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
* **Register-Level Programming:** Configuring MCU peripherals (GPIO, Timers, ADC) by manipulating specific memory-mapped registers.
* **Peripheral Interfacing:** Communicating with external hardware like LCDs, Keypads, Sensors, and Actuators.
* **Communication Protocols:** Implementing and debugging **UART**, **SPI**, and **I2C (TWI)** protocols.
* **Interrupt Handling:** Managing real-time events using External and Internal Interrupts.

## 🏗️ Hardware Architecture
The projects primarily target the **Microchip/Atmel ATmega32** family, focusing on the Harvard architecture and RISC instruction set.



### Core Drivers Implemented:
* **MCAL (Microcontroller Abstraction Layer):** GPIO, Timer/Counter, ADC, EEPROM, and WDT.
* **HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer):** Character LCD (4-bit & 8-bit), 4x4 Keypad, DC Motors (PWM), and Seven-Segment Displays.
